# Understanding Programming languages

- Computers understands only binary digits `0's` and `1's`, for example: `01001011`
- in modern system, that have like 64bit cpus,means it can process instruction up to 64bits at once
- This is tedious for a software engineer to write having to deal with portability across different platforms
- `Assembly` came up and was more readable.
- The downside of assembly was understanding the code. and it requires a lot of instructions for a simple program.
- Portablity was also an issue with assembly as the code will need to be modified for different platforms
- High level languages came into existence and we are able to write shorter instructions compared to assembly which had to be assembled by an assembler.
- Examples of high level languages includes Java, C, C++, Python and Javascript.
- High level languages need to be translated back to machine level code.
- They are either compiled or interpreted.
- For example, C++ is compiled, the compilation generates an executable which can be run directly. 
- Interpreted languages are compiled and executed one instruction at a time.
- Compiled languages are faster compared to interpreted languages.


> Closing remark: Great learning here. time for C++ history
